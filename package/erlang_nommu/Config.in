	  Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable
	  soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.
	  Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer
	  telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has
	  built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

	  This package provides a port of Erlang to run on uClinux (without an MMU).
